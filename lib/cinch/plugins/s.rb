      # Replace a part of one of your previous messages. Specifying the 'i' flag
      # at the end of your regular expression group will execute a case
      # insensitive search. Specifying the 'g' flag will search through the global
      # message list rather than the user's own list. Because the searched string
      # is parsed as a Regexp object, Ruby regex syntax is fully supported (this
      # includes referring to captured groups in the replacement section). The
      # bot's messages are not tracked, nor are calls to commands.
